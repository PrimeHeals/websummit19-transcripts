Good morning. So welcome to the official first day of Web Summit 2019. The CEO of Web Summit, Paddy Cosgrave has lost his voice. I think it was a little bit too much night summit activities last night. He'll be out. During the week you'll, see, you'll see lots of Paddy, but we're just going to kick things off here. Casey and myself. 
Yep. So my name is Casey Lau, I'm the co host of RISE. 
And my name is Sunil Sharma. I'm the Managing Director of Techstars, Toronto and also the co host of Collision.
So Sunil, tell me, this is, what year is this of Web Summit for you?
So this will be my eighth year ever since the early days in Dublin. And of all the collisions and all of your RISE conferences as well.
So what are you looking forward to the most over the next three days?
So representing Techstars. I mean, our our main interests, and I'm so fortunate to have so many of my colleagues here from all around the world, is to find and interact and discover the incredible entrepreneurs that are here. There are more than 2000 startups exhibiting over the next three days here in Lisbon. It's an incredible number. You come from all over the world. And we're here to help you in any way we can as you build and launch, you know, some of the most disruptive companies the world will ever see. So that's my interest. Casey, what about you?
I'm very interested in listening to the CEOs of Canva, Wikipedia, and Mozilla. They're all women in tech, and they're all here on center stage to talk about how they're taking their companies into the future. So that to me is very exciting. 
Absolutely. 
Okay, so let's get this ball rolling. Let's get it rolling.
